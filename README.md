### Fast Facts

* Targeted at **language learners** who need what the speaker is saying and the translation in user's native language.
* 100+ languages supported. ðŸŒŽ
* Uses captions from video if available. (YouTube only, Netflix & Amazon support coming)
* If second language is unavailable, it uses Google Translate to translate captions into target language.
* Free! No API key required.

### Intro

As someone learning a foreign language, it is helpful for me to see both what the speaker is saying and the translation.

This Chrome Extension creates a MutationObserver which waits for new caption elements to be added to the DOM. It then translates the text of these captions and adds the translated captions underneath.  If the video has subtitles in the second language, it uses those subtitles as translations and marks them with a âœ“. (YouTube only, Netflix & Amazon coming soon)
