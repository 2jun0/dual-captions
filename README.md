### Fast Facts

* 100+ languages supported. ðŸŒŽ
* Uses Google Translate to translate captions into target language.

### Intro

As someone learning a foreign language, it is helpful for me to see both what the speaker is saying and the translation. 

As of March 2018, YouTube and Netflix can only show captions in one language. 

This Chrome Extension creates a MutationObserver which waits for new caption elements to be added to the DOM. It then translates the text of these captions and adds the translated captions underneath.

### Usage

Building the extension locally requires having Node and Yarn installed. See https://nodejs.org/ and https://yarnpkg.com/ for installation steps.
